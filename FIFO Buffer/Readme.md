## Introduction
In this directory , I have implemented FIFO-Buffer based on VHDL language. This implementation is divided into 3 part ( fifo regfile, fifo controller, fifo buffer ). Indeed, fifo-buffer is combination of regfile and controller. Another test-bench file is provided in order to test simulate this implemetation. The output results are shown in following sections:
