## Introduction
In this directory , I have implemented n-digit counter based on VHDL language. This implementation is divided into 2 parts ( decimal counter, n-digit-counter ). Decimal counter is impelemented for counting single digit. Then we have used several decimal counter and combined them to create multi-digit counter. The output results are shown in following sections:
